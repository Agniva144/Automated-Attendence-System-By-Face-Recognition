# Automated-Attendence-System-By-Face-Recognition
'Face-recognition based attendance' is a system that records attendance by using Face Recognition.

In this project, face databases
will be created to pump data into the recognizer algorithm. Then, during the attendance
taking session, faces will be compared against the database to seek for identity. When an
individual is identified, its attendance will be taken down automatically saving necessary
information into an excel sheet. At the end of the day, the excel sheet containing attendance
information regarding all individuals are mailed to the respective faculty.
